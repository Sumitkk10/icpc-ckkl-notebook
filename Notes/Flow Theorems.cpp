Max number of edge disjoint paths from source to sink is equal to max flow.
Max number of node disjoint paths:
  a) Divide each node A into Ain and Aout
  b) All inward edges to A go to Ain
  c) One edge from Ain to Aout
  d) All outward edges from A go from Aout
  e) Find max flow
Maximum Biparitite Matching:
  Add source and sink and find max flow
Minimum Node Cover: Minimum set such that every edge has an end point in set
For bipartite graph, Minimum node cover = MCBM
Path Cover: A set of paths such that each node is part of at least one path
Minimum Node-disjoint path cover: 
  a) We create a matching graph. Where each node A has two parts, Aleft and Aright
  b) If there is edge from A to B in G, then there is edge from Aleft to Bright in new graph
  c) Find MCBM
Minimum General Path Cover:
  a) We create a matching graph. Where each node A has two parts, Aleft and Aright
  b) If there is edge from A to B in G, then there is a path from Aleft to Bright in new graph
  c) Find MCBM
Antichain: set of nodes such that there is no path between any pair of nodes
Dilworth's Theorem: Size of maximum antichain in DAG = Size of maximum general path cover
